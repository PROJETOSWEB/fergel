$msg is an array, and you can add as many variables as you like.

For example you can add
$msg = array($name, $email, $hobbies, $color, $blah)
	$name = 'name';
	$email = 'email';
	$message = 'message';
	$hobbies = 'hobbies';
	$color = 'color';
	$blah = 'blah';
	
make sure you define each variable you add to the name you want to name the
specific form field in your form. 

The name to the right is the name you name your form field.
For example
<input type="text" name="hobbies">

You can add whatever you want to $mailheaders. 
I have it so that it will send the persons IP address. 
But you can get rid of that and put whatever you want. The "\n"
equals a break.

Now we mail everything off.

mail($name, $email, join("\n", $msg), $mailheaders);

Make sure you put join("\n", $msg)
What that does is joins all the variables in the array together to make it a string.

Im a newbie to php. This should work. It did for me. Anyhow, enjoy 
and do whatever the heck you want with it.
